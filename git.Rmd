title: "Git and GitHub"
---

Our course will make extensive use of git and GitHub using the GitHub Classroom platform. In short, our course repositories will hold our class notes, data, info and discussions (the website you are currently viewing is also a part of our repository).


### What are git and GitHub?

[git](https://git-scm.com/) is the *de facto* go-to solution for version control. Think of "track changes" on steroids for code files. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the leading cloud hosting service of git repositories, that enables efficient and transparent code sharing and collaboration.


### Git installation

Go [**here**](http://git-scm.com/downloads) to download a graphical Git installer appropriate for your machineâ€™s operating system (Mac / Windows).

Run the installer and follow its instructions to install the software. Usually the default options are all we need for configuring Git.


### Open a GitHub account
  
Go [**here**](http://github.com) to register an account if you have not got one. It is highly recommended to choose a straightforward username (e.g., *itamarcaspi* instead of *icaspi99*) so that your are easily found.

### GitHub Desktop installation

GitHub Desktop provides a straightforward GUI interface to git and GitHub. It enables you to easily sync between your local and remote folders and apply basic git commands with a click of a button. (For more advanced git commands, you will have to use the Shell.)

Go [**here**](https://desktop.github.com/) to download GitHub Desktop, and follow the installation guide. 

### Cloning the __course-spring2019__ repository

1. Once git, GitHub account and GitHub desktop are all set, visit  [here](https://github.com/huji-ml4econ/course-spring2019) to open our course's __course-spring2019__ repository.   

2. Once in the repository, click on the green **Clone or download** button, while making sure that GitHub Desktop is running in the background (this is important!):  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/clone.gif")

```

3.If done correctly, GitHub Desktop should prompt you with a request for a local destination for the __course-spring2019__ cloned repo. Choose where you want to install your local copy of the repo, click OK, and we're done. 


### Keeping your local repo synced

To keep your copy of the __course-spring2019__ repo up to date follow these steps:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Set the Current repository to __course-spring2019__.
3. Click on the "Fetch origin" button.
4. If it says Pull with a number next to it (e.g., "Pull" +1), click on it and you're done.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/pull.gif")

```
