## Git installation

Git is the *de facto* go-to solution for version control.

Go [**here**](http://git-scm.com/downloads) to download a graphical Git installer appropriate for your machineâ€™s operating system (Mac / Windows).

Run the installer and follow its instructions to install the software. Usually the default options are all we need for configuring Git.

**Important Note for Windows Users**: after Git installation, please open your command-line terminal and run the following code:
  
**`git config --system core.longpaths true`**
  
  
## GitHub installation
  
GitHub is the leading online hosting service of Git repositories.

Go [**here**](http://github.com) to register an account if you have not got one.

## GitHub Desktop installation

Go [**here**](https://desktop.github.com/) to download GitHub Desktop.
