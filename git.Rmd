title: "Git and GitHub"

Git is the *de facto* go-to solution for version control. Think of "track changes" on steroids for code files. GitHub is the leading cloud hosting service of Git repositories, that enables efficient and transparent code sharing and collaboration.


### Git installation

Go [**here**](http://git-scm.com/downloads) to download a graphical Git installer appropriate for your machineâ€™s operating system (Mac / Windows).

Run the installer and follow its instructions to install the software. Usually the default options are all we need for configuring Git.


### Open a GitHub account
  
Go [**here**](http://github.com) to register an account if you have not got one. It is highly recommended to choose a straightforward username (e.g., *itamarcaspi* instead of *icaspi99*) so that your are easily found.

### GitHub Desktop installation

GitHub Desktop provides a straightforward GUI interface to git and GitHub. It enables you to easily sync between your local and remote folders and apply basic git commands with a click of a button. 

Go [**here**](https://desktop.github.com/) to download GitHub Desktop, and follow the installation guide. 

### Cloning the `ml4econ` repository

Once git, GitHub and GitHub desktop are all set, open GitHub Desktop and go [**here**]() to open our `ml4econ` course repository. Once in the repository, click on the green **Clone or download** button (top right, above the folders and files pane). If done correctly, GitHub Desktop should prompt you with a request for a local destination for the `ml4econ` repository. Choose where you want to install your local copy of the `ml4econ` repo, click OK, and we're done. 

### Keeping your local `ml4econ` repo synced

GitHub Desktop can help you keep your copy of the `ml4econ` repo up to date by following these steps:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Set the Current repository to `ml4econ`.
3. Click on the "Fetch origin" button.
4. If it says Pull with a number next to it (e.g., "Pull" +1), click on it and you're done.
