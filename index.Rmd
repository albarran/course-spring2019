## Course summary

The course will cover topics that range between machine learning (ML) and econometrics. In particular, we will discuss concepts from the world of ML that can potentially contribute to empirical economics. The course will cover leading machine learning (supervised and unsupervised) methods, with an emphasis on the challenges and opportunities of integrating these methods in empirical economics, and the relevance of ML to policy analysis and causal inference. The various topics are illustrated through applications, reading empirical articles, and doing applied work.


## Computing

All computing in class will be conducted in R.
The focus of the class will be on teaching Machine Learning concepts rather than how to use R.


## Textbooks

There are no required textbooks. All materials notes will be available on the class website. The following books may be useful references, however, note that they do not cover all the material we plan to cover in the class.

[**An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R**](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL) <br>
*Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani* <br>
This book provides a hands-on and R-based introduction to Machine Learning. <br/>
_PDF available online_

[**Elements of Statistical Learning**](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn) <br>
*Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman* <br/>
This book covers the same topics as previous book (and more), however, it provides more rigorous treatment. <br>
_PDF available online_


The following three books provide undergrad and graduate level treatment of causal inference in social sciences:

[**Mostly Harmless Econometrics**](http://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/) <br/>
*Joshua Angrist and Jorn-Steffen Pischke*


[**Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences**](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139025751) <br/>
*Guido Imbens and Donald Rubin*
