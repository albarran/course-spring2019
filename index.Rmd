Welcome to __ml4econ__, the **M**achine **L**earning for **Econ**omists coures repository!  


## Course summary

The course will cover topics that range between machine learning (ML) and econometrics. In particular, we will discuss concepts from the world of ML that can potentially contribute to empirical economics. The course will cover leading machine learning (supervised and unsupervised) methods, with an emphasis on the challenges and opportunities of integrating these methods in empirical economics, and the relevance of ML to policy analysis and causal inference. The various topics are illustrated through applications, reading empirical articles, and doing applied work.

## Computing

All computing in class will be conducted in R. Nevertheless, we encourage you to give Python a try as well. In general though, the focus of the class will be on teaching concepts rather than how to use R or Python. 


## Grading

Homework assignments: **20%**; Final exam: **40%**; Final project: **40%**
