**Q:** Why `R` and not `Python`?  
  
**A:** There is nothing that [R can do that Pyhton can't](https://www.quora.com/What-can-R-do-that-Python-cant) and [vice verca](https://www.quora.com/What-can-Python-do-that-R-cant). From our perspective, the main difference between these two is their purpose - Python is a general purpose programming language, whereas R was designed for data analytics. This means that R comes with thousands of built-in and user contributed libraries that help with statistical and econometric analysis. Python can do all that, but in many cases, you'll need to code R procedures in Python from scratch.  
For instance, during this course we will make use of a package named `causalTrees` (by Susan Athey) that uses regression trees in order to estimate *heterogenous* treatment effects. `causalTrees` was built upon the popular `rpart` R package, and was adjusted for the purpose of estimating causal effects. If you wanted to perform a causal tree analysis with Python, you'll have to program the whole thing by yourself. While this could be a valuable exercise, with a possible high payoff for whoever does it, it is way beyond the scope of this course.
