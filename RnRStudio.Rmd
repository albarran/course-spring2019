title: "R and RStudio"
---

To get started, you first need to install R. Next, we highly recommend using RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes working with R much easier (RStudio's setup will be familiar for those of you who have prior experience with Matlab's IDE). RStudio comes with the very handy `RProj` environment and provieds many built-in features that help facilitate data analysis and modelling tasks. In addition, RStudio integrates RMarkdown notebooks that and git, thus enabling us to efficiently work with version control. 


### Install R

Go to [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and click on the download link that suits your OS.


### Install RStudio

Go to [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website and click on the download button. The free version is more than what you need for this course.

Two recommended settings:

1. Go to **Tools -> General Options -> General** and set the Save workspace to .RData on exit to *NEVER*. This option improves the replicability of your projects since it causes you to start every project in a new R session, i.e., a clean environment and without any packages pre-loaded. Remmeber: If you need your R script to start with `rm(list=ls())` than are doing it wrong!

2. Go to **Tools -> General Options -> Git/SVN** and check the "Enable version control interface to RStudio projects" box. Next, make sure that the "Git executable" points to the git binary file (e.g., "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe").


### Alternativs to RStudio

If for some reason you insist on not using RStudio, we can suggest a couple alternative open-source IDEs:

1. [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) coupled with the [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) extension.
2. [Atom](https://atom.io/) coupled with the [ide-r](https://atom.io/packages/ide-r) and [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) extensions.

Note that all IDEs, RStudio included depend on R being installed.
